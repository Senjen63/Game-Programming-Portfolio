There are a couple of issues within the game that I am aware of but was not able to fix in a reasonable amount of time 

-Sometimes the food and powerups spawn outside of the walls, despite my best efforts I could not get them inside,
however you do not become soft locked in this situation ad the hitbox is still reachable just move the snake on edge of the wall to collect
the item eventually 

-The HUD does not work properly, the only par tof it that actually prints is the score and it writes over itself

-I did not feel comfortable creating a proper event system as I have the space key doing multiple things and I did not want to try and 
I did not feel as though I had the proper time to handle it.

I think that's it but I just wanted ot make sure those things were noted
