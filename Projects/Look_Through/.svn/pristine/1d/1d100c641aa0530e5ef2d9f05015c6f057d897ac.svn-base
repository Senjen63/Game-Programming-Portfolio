/*
Game
The class which holds all systems and has the game loop 

Data
• The GraphicsSystem object
• The InputSystem object
• Other data necessary to fulfill the requirements of the assignment

Public Functions
• Constructor/Destructor
• Init/Cleanup
• DoLoop – contains the actual loop ( I suggest a while loop).  Things to do, not necessarily in this order:
	o Get user input
	o Adjust game state (based on user input and other automatic factors)
	o Draw current game state
	o Wait until the target amount of time has elapsed
• Make sure you are timing the game loop
