Files Changed:
Game.cpp - doLoop & handleEvent
Game.h - Game class - private
InputSystem.cpp - update

Added a new background with many variations for the menus and settings in the three languages. However, something is wrong with the settings.
When I run the code and press P to enter the settings, I see the english settings page, but then the entire program freezes.
I would assume that it has to do with something in handleEvent or the while loops I have within doLoop in Game.cpp.
I also haven't added the load feature or difficulty change feature completely yet, but I have it listening for the inputs to do those things. 
If you are able to, feel free to get the loading working (ONLY if it can be done easily). We can still demo it in other ways.
Even if you can get the settings working properly, I'll still need to get the difficulties to change. I can do that later though, just need to show
Dean that we can navigate the menus and that the language can be changed
