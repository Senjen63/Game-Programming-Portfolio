          Upon completing my studies in May 2024 at Champlain College in Burlington Vermont I will have received my bachelor’s degree in computer science majoring in <br>
          “Game Programming”. While attending Champlain College I have acquired a strong foundation in programming languages such as Unity, Unreal Engine, C++, C#, <br>
          and HTML. Having the knowledge and now experience using these various languages I’ve had the opportunity to put my programming skills to work as I’ve <br>
          completed several projects in a team environment.  Our final project entitled “Molementum” was a game we successfully created with a team consisting of me, a <br>
          second programmer, an illustrator, project manager and an animator.  The excitement of being part of the game creation process is the reason I chose this career <br>
          path.

          <br>
          Some personal things about me, I’m from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, my hobbies include watching Anime and in my free time taking on challenging brain activities <br>
          such as puzzle solving. I enjoy spending time with my family and traveling.
