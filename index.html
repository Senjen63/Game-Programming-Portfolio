            Hello, my name is Eugene Bryant Jr., and I am working towards becoming a gameplay programmer.<br>
            I will complete my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in May 2024.<br>
            I have been diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome, and although sometimes challenging, it does not define who I am or what my abilities are.<br> 
            I am a hard worker, and my experiences have taught me to adapt to change.<br>
            After taking Computer Science & Programming in high school and learning some Javascript and HTML, I became interested in coding.<br>
            While at Champlain College, I have learned and am still learning C++, C#, Unity, and Unreal Engine.<br>
            With my current knowledge of coding languages, I have found that I enjoy it while feeling challenged at the same time.<br>
            I enjoy playing video games (especially RPG/JRPG, Fighting, and Platformer) and watching Marvel and DC movies. <br>
            My hobbies are watching Anime, doing brain activities such as puzzles.<br>
            I also enjoy spending time with my family. 
            I’m looking forward to making contributions in the game development industry.
